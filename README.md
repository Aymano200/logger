# IP Data to Discord Webhook

With this simple JavaScript programm you can log the IP of someone visiting your website.
A user then can get redirected to the main part of your domain or just bind the index.js file and Jquery into your code, to IP-log him.

# Use it
You need JQuery imported through a CDN. Instructions can be found at the beginning of `index.js` and `index.html`.
